"""Tests for the match engine.

I edit the rule often, so this is the set of cases I re-run after every change.
If one breaks, I either changed something on purpose or I made a mistake -
either way I want to catch it here and not in the detector.

Runs offline: no network, no database, just the classification logic.

Run with:  python -m pytest tests/ -v
