"""Builds a throwaway database for the CI smoke run.

GitHub Actions has no access to Project 1's real database, so this makes a
minimal stand-in: `companies` comes from config/boards.csv, and the Project 2
tables are created from the SQL files. The detector then runs against this
exactly as it would against the real one - it just starts from empty signals.
